# ASDAAAS Operations Guide

How to start, stop, restart, and monitor the ASDAAAS agent infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

```
miniircd (IRC server, port 6667)
  └── IRC adapter (one nick per agent)
        ├── reads from: agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/irc/outbox/
        └── writes to:  agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/irc/inbox/

asdaaas (one per agent)
  ├── reads from: agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/*/inbox/
  ├── writes to:  agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/*/outbox/
  └── delivers:   agents/<Name>/asdaaas/doorbells/

localmail (async agent-to-agent messaging)
  ├── watches: agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/localmail/inbox/
  └── rings:   agents/<Name>/asdaaas/doorbells/

TUI adapter (interactive terminal)
  ├── reads from: agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/tui/outbox/
  └── writes to:  agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/tui/inbox/
```

## Configuration

All components read from `agents.json` (in the ops/ directory) or `config.json`
(in the core/ directory). Edit these files to set paths and agent definitions.
See `config.json.template` for the schema.

## Startup Order

Start in this order. Later components depend on earlier ones.

### 1. IRC server + adapter

```bash
bash ops/launch_irc_server.sh    # starts miniircd on port 6667
bash ops/launch_irc_adapter.sh   # connects all agents from agents.json
```

**Check:** `ss -tlnp | grep 6667` and `tail -5 /tmp/irc_adapter.log`

### 2. ASDAAAS agents

```bash
bash ops/launch_asdaaas.sh              # launch all agents from agents.json
bash ops/launch_asdaaas.sh AgentOne     # launch specific agent
```

**Check:** `tail -5 /tmp/asdaaas_agentone.log`

### 3. Supporting adapters

```bash
bash ops/launch_localmail.sh     # agent-to-agent messaging
bash ops/launch_heartbeat.sh     # idle nudges
bash ops/launch_remind.sh        # scheduled doorbells
```

Context and session adapters run inside asdaaas (no separate process needed).

### 4. TUI (interactive terminal)

```bash
python3 adapters/asdaaas_tui.py --agent AgentOne --agents-home /path/to/agents
```

**Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (textual, rich)

## Shutdown

### Stop everything
```bash
bash ops/stop_asdaaas.sh           # graceful shutdown of all agents + adapters
```

### Stop specific agents
```bash
bash ops/stop_asdaaas.sh AgentOne AgentTwo
```

### Force stop (skip graceful shutdown)
```bash
bash ops/stop_asdaaas.sh --force
```

## Restart Procedures

### Restart all agents (pick up code changes)
```bash
bash ops/stop_asdaaas.sh && sleep 2 && bash ops/launch_asdaaas.sh
```

### Restart one agent
```bash
bash ops/restart_agent.sh AgentOne
```

## Monitoring

### Dashboard
```bash
python3 dashboard/projects_dashboard.py
```

### Health files
```bash
# Agent health (asdaaas writes after each turn)
cat agents/<Name>/asdaaas/health.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Logs

All logs go to `/tmp/` by default (configurable in agents.json):

| Component | Log file |
|-----------|----------|
| miniircd | `/tmp/miniircd.log` |
| IRC adapter | `/tmp/irc_adapter.log` |
| asdaaas \<agent\> | `/tmp/asdaaas_<agent>.log` |
| Heartbeat adapter | `/tmp/heartbeat_adapter.log` |
| Localmail | `/tmp/localmail.log` |

### Queue depths
```bash
# Check for stuck messages
ls agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/irc/inbox/ | wc -l
ls agents/<Name>/asdaaas/doorbells/ | wc -l
```

## Sending Localmail

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/asdaaas/core')
from localmail import send_mail
send_mail('AgentOne', 'AgentTwo', 'Status update please')
```

## Gaze and Awareness

Agents control their own gaze and awareness via commands (do NOT hand-edit JSON files):

```json
{"action": "gaze", "adapter": "irc", "room": "#general"}
{"action": "gaze", "adapter": "irc", "pm": "username"}
{"action": "gaze", "adapter": "tui"}
{"action": "awareness", "add": "#channel", "mode": "doorbell"}
```

See `ASDAAAS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for full command reference.

## Agent Self-Compaction

Agents request compaction via command queue:

```json
{"action": "compact"}
```

Flow: agent writes command -> asdaaas issues confirmation doorbell -> agent touches confirm file -> compaction executes. Agent gets 3 turns to confirm.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding to IRC messages
1. Check asdaaas log: `tail -20 /tmp/asdaaas_<agent>.log`
2. Check IRC adapter log: `tail -20 /tmp/irc_adapter.log`
3. Check inbox queue: `ls agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/irc/inbox/`
4. Check outbox queue: `ls agents/<Name>/asdaaas/adapters/irc/outbox/`
5. Check health: `cat agents/<Name>/asdaaas/health.json`

### Agent responses are "one behind" (desync)

**Symptom:** Agent responds to message N when you send message N+1. The IRC
adapter log shows every inbound/outbound pair as consecutive entries. Profiling
shows `agent_think=0ms` (response is instant because it's reading stale data).

**Root cause:** `collect_response()` timed out (120s) during a long response
(typically auto-compaction + tool calls). The unread tail of that response
stayed in the stdio pipe. Every subsequent `collect_response` call reads the
PREVIOUS response's leftover chunks instead of the current response.

**How it happened originally:** Cinco auto-compacted mid-response (IN[7]).
The response involved tool calls + post-compaction recovery and took 120+
seconds. `collect_response` timed out, returned 44 chars of speech, and left
hundreds of chars of chunks + tool_call events + prompt_complete in the pipe.
From that point on, every response was shifted one behind.

**Fix (applied in asdaaas.py):** `drain_stale_frames()` is called before each
new prompt. It reads any buffered frames with a 50ms timeout (instant if data
is present, 50ms cost if pipe is clean). Recovered speech chunks are delivered
to the outbox rather than silently dropped. Fragments are logged and discarded.

**Diagnosis steps:**
1. Check asdaaas log for `agent_think=0ms` on multiple consecutive messages
2. Compare asdaaas log response content with session `updates.jsonl` — if they
   differ, the pipe is desynced
3. Look for `streaming=113000ms+` or `total=120000ms+` entries — these are
   timeout events that may have caused the desync
4. Look for `auto_compact_started` / `auto_compact_completed` in the log near
   the first desynced message
5. After deploying the fix, look for `[asdaaas] DRAIN:` log lines — these
   confirm stale frames were caught and handled

### Localmail doorbell not delivered
1. Check localmail log: `tail -20 /tmp/localmail.log`
2. Check if target is detected as asdaaas agent: health file must be < 1 hour old
3. Check doorbell directory: `ls ~/agents/Q/asdaaas/doorbells/`
4. Check asdaaas log for doorbell pickup: `grep -i doorbell /tmp/asdaaas_q.log | tail -5`

### OOM / memory issues
1. Check RSS: `ps aux --sort=-rss | grep grok | head -5`
2. Check updates.jsonl sizes: `du -sh ~/.grok/sessions/*/updates.jsonl 2>/dev/null`
3. **NEVER use `is_background: true` for long-running processes** — causes updates.jsonl bloat
4. Always use `setsid nohup` via launch scripts

### Agent session corruption
1. Check session directory exists: `ls ~/.grok/sessions/%2Fhome%2Feric/019d1ec1*/`
2. CWD must match session creation path (URL-encoded)
3. If session won't load, create new session (omit `--session` flag)

## Version Check

```bash
bash ops/asdaaas_version.sh   # shows RUNNING vs HEAD commit for each agent
grok --version                # grok binary version
```
